# COVID-19 Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a COVID-19 dataset analysis tool using Python. It features data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization of confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and regional statistics. The project employs `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` to provide insights and trends through comprehensive exploratory data analysis.

## Features
- **Data Loading**: Load COVID-19 dataset from CSV file.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and convert data types.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Summary statistics of the dataset.
  - Distribution of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
  - New cases, deaths, and recoveries over time.
  - Regional analysis by WHO regions.
  - Case fatality rate and recovery rate analysis.
  - Weekly change analysis in confirmed cases.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate informative visualizations using `matplotlib`.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
## Dataset
country_wise_latest dataset is used for this project. Download this from kaggle.
## IDE 
Use better IDE like Jupyter Notebook for better visualisation. Other IDE's like PyCharm,Anaconda also fit for this project.
## Results
-Confirmed Cases: Provided a comprehensive summary including total, mean, median, and quartiles.
Deaths and Recoveries: Highlighted the key statistics such as total deaths, total recoveries, and their distributions across different regions.

-Distribution of Confirmed Cases, Deaths, and Recoveries:
Histograms depicting the frequency of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
Trends Over Time:
Line plots showing the number of new cases, deaths, and recoveries over time to visualize the pandemic's progression.

-Growth Patterns:
Identified regions with the highest growth rates of COVID-19 cases.
Mortality and Recovery:
Provided insights into regions with higher case fatality rates and recovery rates.
Impact of Interventions:
Analyzed the effect of interventions (like lockdowns) on the trends of new cases and deaths.
